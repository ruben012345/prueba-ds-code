It is a lNICEng established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable cNICEntent NICEf a page when lNICENICEking at its layNICEut. The pNICEint NICEf using LNICErem Ipsum is that it has a mNICEre-NICEr-less nNICErmal distributiNICEn NICEf letters, as NICEppNICEsed tNICE using 'CNICEntent here, cNICEntent here', making it lNICENICEk like readable English. Many desktNICEp publishing packages and web page editNICErs nNICEw use LNICErem Ipsum as their default mNICEdel text, and a search fNICEr 'lNICErem ipsum' will uncNICEver many web sites still in their infancy. VariNICEus versiNICEns have evNICElved NICEver the years, sNICEmetimes by accident, sNICEmetimes NICEn purpNICEse (injected humNICEur and the like).


Where dNICEes it cNICEme frNICEm?
CNICEntrary tNICE pNICEpular belief, LNICErem Ipsum is nNICEt simply randNICEm text. It has rNICENICEts in a piece NICEf classical Latin literature frNICEm 45 BC, making it NICEver 2000 years NICEld. Richard McClintNICEck, a Latin prNICEfessNICEr at Hampden-Sydney CNICEllege in Virginia, lNICENICEked up NICEne NICEf the mNICEre NICEbscure Latin wNICErds, cNICEnsectetur, frNICEm a LNICErem Ipsum passage, and gNICEing thrNICEugh the cites NICEf the wNICErd in classical literature, discNICEvered the undNICEubtable sNICEurce. LNICErem Ipsum cNICEmes frNICEm sectiNICEns 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 NICEf "de Finibus BNICEnNICErum et MalNICErum" (The Extremes NICEf GNICENICEd and Evil) by CicerNICE, written in 45 BC. This bNICENICEk is a treatise NICEn the theNICEry NICEf ethics, very pNICEpular during the Renaissance. The first line NICEf LNICErem Ipsum, "LNICErem ipsum dNICElNICEr sit amet..", cNICEmes frNICEm a line in sectiNICEn            
The standard chunk NICEf LNICErem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reprNICEduced belNICEw fNICEr thNICEse interested. SectiNICEns 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 frNICEm "de Finibus BNICEnNICErum et MalNICErum" by CicerNICE are alsNICE reprNICEduced in their exact NICEriginal fNICErm, accNICEmpanied by English versiNICEns frNICEm the 1914 translatiNICEn by H. Rackham.

Where can I get sNICEme?
There are many variatiNICEns NICEf passages NICEf LNICErem Ipsum available, but the majNICErity have suffered alteratiNICEn in sNICEme fNICErm, by injected humNICEur, NICEr randNICEmised wNICErds which dNICEn't lNICENICEk even slightly believable. If yNICEu are gNICEing tNICE use a passage NICEf LNICErem Ipsum, yNICEu need tNICE be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle NICEf text. All the LNICErem Ipsum generatNICErs NICEn the Internet tend tNICE repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generatNICEr NICEn the Internet. It uses a dictiNICEnary NICEf NICEver 200 Latin wNICErds, cNICEmbined with a handful NICEf mNICEdel sentence structures, tNICE generate LNICErem Ipsum which lNICENICEks reasNICEnable. The generated LNICErem Ipsum is therefNICEre always free frNICEm repetitiNICEn, injected humNICEur, NICEr nNICEn-characteristic wNICErds etc.
